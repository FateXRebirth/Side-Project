# Side-Project

Writing a [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) application in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a bit painful, Especially when I want to scale up or refactoring my whole application, or I want to use some function in the third-party library, I have to  either find a typed version of that library to integrate or use some tricky way to make [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) not throw a compile error, since the above reason, I decided to rewrite my application. I won't change my data source, it still will be [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), because I have not plan to use any cloud hosting like [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) or [linode](https://www.linode.com/), 
Of course, There are some limitation if I use GitHub Pages to host my website application, But for this stage, it is enough, I am trying something new and novel.

After Researching, I am going to use some framework like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) to keep building this application, The reason I choose these two frameworks not only they are written by [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) which are the mainstream of JS Framework now, but also they have some awesome features, They can help you boost up the speed while developing, including customizable server, hot-reloading, optimize your code, and allow you to use the newest feature of JavaScript through [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), most importantly, it can generate web application on any static hosting, also support Server-side Render (SSR) which can resolve some issue about Search Engine Optimize (SEO), make you become a Full-Stack Developer!
