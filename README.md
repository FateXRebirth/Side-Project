# Side-Project

Writing a **[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)** application in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a bit painful, Especially when I want to scale up or refactoring my whole application, or I want to use some function in the third-party library, I have to  either find a typed version of that library to integrate or use some tricky way to make [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) not throw a compile error, since the above reason, I decided to rewrite my application. I won't change my data source, it still will be [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), because I have not plan to use any cloud hosting like [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) or [linode](https://www.linode.com/), 
Of course, There are some limitation if I use GitHub Pages to host my website application, But for this stage, it is enough, I am trying something new and novel.
